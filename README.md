For this project, I were given a scenario where a Colorado Board of Elections employee requested my help in completing an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The following tasks were performd by me to be included in the completed election audit:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Calculate the list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the list of counties were votes were cast
4. Calculate the total number and percentage of votes each candidate received
5. Calculate the total number and percentage of votes that were cast in each county
6. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 
7. Determine the county that received the highest number of votes
8. Present our outcome printed to the terminal and a separate output text file.
